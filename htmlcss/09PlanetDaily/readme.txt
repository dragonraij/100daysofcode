Planet Daily
=========

Planet Daily is a global news agency. They are based in metropolis 
but have a presence in most regions of the world. This allows them 
to be wherever the news is happening and no matter what is happening
whether it is a civil uprising or an attack by a super villian.

In this changing world and changing times, they want to keep in the 
for front of what is happening. To help in this they require a 
redesign of their home page.

In this project we will be using bootstrap elements to style the
home page.
